## 1. Application features
### 1.1 Connecting to server
After launching the application, it checks, does the smartphone, on which the application is running, have Bluetooth module. If module is not available, dialog informing user, that application cannot function properly, will appear. Otherwise, if Bluetooth is available, application enables it in background. After enabling Bluetooth, process of establishing connection to the server on RaspberryPi board starts, what is demonstrated in the Picture 1.0.
